I am looking for a post-doc position. Before that, I did my PhD at school of SEIEE, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I was advised by **Prof. Cewu Lu**. I did my master at the same lab. I did my bachelor at the School of the Gifted Young, University of Science and Technology of China.

I visited NUS, advised by [Prof. Shao Lin](https://linsats.github.io/) and collaborated with [Prof. Harold Soh](https://haroldsoh.com/). 

My research focuses on human-centric intelligent system: **brain**-robot interface, **muscle**-actuated control, visual-**tactile** perception, **dexterous** manipulation. I found and lead the [RobotFlow project](https://robotflow.ai), which contains full-stack solution to multi-modal perception, planning and control, multi-physics & musculoskeletal simulation. This infrastructure supports all the research in my team!
