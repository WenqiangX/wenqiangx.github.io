description: <p> Human is the measure of all things. Thus, to achieve truly general intelligence, we should strive to create a system that can think and act comparably to humans. Admittedly, for many tasks, we don't need a system as sophisticated as a human being. We also don't need to fully comprehend the mechanisms of human intelligence to develop a system with remarkable generalization capabilities. However, these system are still not generalist agent, no matter what the PR says. <br/> My research interest starts from general object understanding, and has recently shifted to human-centric manipulation. Many onging projects in new areas do not reflect in the paper list yet. </p>
