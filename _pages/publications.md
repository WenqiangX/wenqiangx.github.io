description: <p> Human is the measure of all things. Thus, to achieve truly general intelligence, we should strive to create a system that can think and act comparably to humans. Admittedly, for many tasks, we don't require a system as sophisticated as a human being. We also don't need to fully comprehend the mechanisms of human intelligence to develop a system with remarkable generalization capabilities. However, until we uncover the underlying theory, emulating and studying the human itself remains the most logical path towards general AI.<p>
